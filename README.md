# Algorithms
This repository contains algorithms I implemented from scratch in order to advance my algorithmic problem-solving and Python skills. 

Every line of code in this repository is mine.
I understood the pseudocode of the algorithm and then implemented it from scratch.
I did not use any implementation ideas from any external source. I struggled until my code worked and then tested it.

**Making a dummy change, just to differ from forked repo.**
